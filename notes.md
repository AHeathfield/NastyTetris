# Notes about Tetris

- Show the next 3 blocks that will be places

- Up arrow rotates block
- Down arrow does fast fall
    - Each square distance traveled while fast falling adds 1 to score

- For scoring (my way)
    - Each line is worth 100 points, if you get like 3 lines in a row you do 300 x 3 for scoring

- Every 10 lines starts a new level, the higher the level the faster the blocks fall

- Have a counter for # of lines, # of levels completed, and score

- You can also hold a block and I'm guessing swap it out with the current one (idk how to do it so i'll just create my own keybinds)

- Title screen shows the high scores (top 10)

- When you die, you can input your initials (3 max)

- There is 4 unique blocks, Straight line, zig zag, square, L
    - The zig zag and L also have a mirrored version

- 20 blocks tall, 10 wide





# NEXT TIME
- limit how fast the hold down key is
